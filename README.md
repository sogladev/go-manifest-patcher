# Go Manifest Patcher

A lightweight Go-based terminal patcher that uses a manifest to manage file updates. It displays a transaction overview, provides detailed progress, and only overwrites files listed in the manifest. It does not remove extra files. Designed for easy extension with minimal dependencies.

### Transaction Overview

The downloader provides a detailed overview before executing downloads:

1. **Up-to-date files**: Files that match the manifest
2. **Outdated files**: Existing files that need updating
3. **Missing files**: New files to download
4. **Extra files**: Files not in manifest that are not ignored by custom filter
5. **Transaction summary**: Shows total download size and disk space impact

You'll be prompted to confirm before proceeding with downloads.

```bash
ï‘  go run main.go -manifest http://localhost:8080/manifest.json
    ____
   / __ )  ____ _   ____    ____   ___    _____
  / __  | / __ `/  / __ \  / __ \ / _ \  / ___/
 / /_/ / / /_/ /  / / / / / / / //  __/ / /
/_____/  \__,_/  /_/ /_/ /_/ /_/ \___/ /_/

Downloading manifest from: http://localhost:8080/manifest.json

Transaction Summary:
 Installing/Updating: 3 files

Total size of inbound files is 5.2 MB. Need to download 5.2 MB.
After this operation, 4.1 MB of additional disk space will be used.
Is this ok [y/N]: y
[1/3] D.bin                     [--------------------] 100% (complete) 2.1 MB
[2/3] F.bin                     [--------------------] 100% (complete) 1.0 MB
[3/3] C.bin                     [--------------------] 100% (complete) 2.1 MB

## Development

### Testing with Local Server

1. Clone both the downloader and server repositories
2. Start the test server (see [server README](./server/README.md))
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   go run main.go
   go run main.go
   ```

3. Run the downloader pointing to the test server's manifest:
   ```bash
   cd ../downloader
   go run main.go -manifest "http://localhost:8080/manifest.json"
   ```

### Manifest Format

The manifest.json should follow this structure:
```json
{
  "Version": "1.0",
  "Files": [
    {
      "Path": "path/to/file",
      "Hash": "file-hash",
      "Size": fileSize,
      "Custom": true,
      "URL": "url-to-file"
    },
}

```

## Testing

For development testing, use the companion test server application which provides:
- Local CDN simulation
- Manifest generation
- Throttled downloads
- Configurable file serving

See the [server README](./server/README.md) for more details on setting up a test environment.
